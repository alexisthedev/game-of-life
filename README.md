## Game Description

"The Game of Life is not your typical computer game. It is a cellular automaton invented by Cambridge mathematician John Conway.

This game became widely known when it was mentioned in an article published by Scientific American in 1970. It consists of a grid of cells which, based on a few mathematical rules, can live, die or multiply. Depending on the initial conditions, the cells form various patterns throughout the game."

## Game Rules
[from www.playgameoflife.com]

### For a space that is populated:
1. Each cell with one or no neighbors dies, as if by solitude.
2. Each cell with four or more neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
3. Each cell with two or three neighbors survives.

### For a space that is empty or unpopulated:
1. Each cell with three neighbors becomes populated.

## What I learned from this project

I got a better understanding of working with dictionaries and accessing their values in different ways depending on whether I want to visualize them, print them, or change them.

I also improved my ability to write code that uses helper functions to increase readability, efficiency, and quality.

## How to run

1. Clone the repository
2. From your command line run "python game-of-life.py" in the file's parent directory.

See also: Windows users should first change the command line's font to "MS Gothic Sans" from the properties menu.

This was created as a part of a college course. Boilerplate code was provided by the professor, and all game code is written solely by the author Alex Papadopoulos Siountris
